What about getting an instant access to a HelloWorld example in a fully configured IDE with any language you want?

Time to take a breath... So this is your chance! Just choose one of the repositories below:

* Python
* [Java]
* JavaScript (Node.js)
* [C#]
* PHP
* Kotlin
* Go

## How does it work?

Each repository has enough configuration to run a fully-integrated VSCode instance in the clouds, and it is just possible because of [Gitpod.io]

From their website:
> Gitpod launches ready-to-code dev environments for your GitHub or GitLab project with a single click

Yes... it is IaaS in its state of art!
