First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! ü§ò‚ù§Ô∏è

## How to ask for a new feature

Go to desired repository and open an [Issue](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/) describing what you want and how it will improve the repository for others.

## How to submit changes

* Open a Pull Request describing the changes;
* Do not forget to mention the issue when it exists.
* Use a clear commit message following the [guideline](#git-commit-message-guideline).

## Git Commit Message Guideline
* Use the present tense ("Add extension" not "Added extension")
* Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
* Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
